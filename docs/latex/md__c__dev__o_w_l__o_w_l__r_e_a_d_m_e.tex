Owl Array Library provides functionality to handle vector arrays in C++, as well as perform basic arithmetic and mathematical operations on them. This library can used by linking the static library and including header files into your project directory.

The member and free functions in this library have been tested using varous tests written using Google Tests. I plan on including the source code for these tests in the upcoming commits. Furthermore, I continue to write further tests as the code further undergoes refactoring, refining and development processes.

Please refer to documentations in the docs folder for contained classes, methods, and functions.
